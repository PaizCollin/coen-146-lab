### Author: Collin Paiz

### Institution: Santa Clara University

### Professor: Dr. Salem Al-Agtash

### Session: Winter 2022

## Overview

#### This includes various C projects from the lab section of COEN 146: Computer Networks.

## Lab 1 - Basic Linux & C

#### Basic C and Linux examples to get started with multi-threading and files.

## Lab 2 - Network Commands & Packet Delay (RTT)

#### Research and implement a project to exemplify RTT for n parallel TCP connections for persistent and non-persistent HTTP

## Lab 3 - TCP/IP Socket Programming (TCP Sockets)

#### Implement a client/server application using TCP/IP sockets. Use C to transfer a file over a TCP/IP socket.

## Lab 4 - UDP/IP Socket Programming (UDP Sockets)

#### Implement a client/server (P2P) application using UDP/IP sockets. Use C to transfer a file over a UDP/IP socket.

## Lab 5 - Stop & Wait

#### Implement a UDP server in C that gets file contents as packets from a client. This UDP provides reliable transport service utilizing the stop and wait protocol, which includes checksums, sequence numbers.

## Lab 6 - Stop & Wait for an Unrealiable Channel With Loss

#### Implement a Stop and Wait protocol on top of UDP to provide a reliable transport service while considering loss.

## Lab 7 - Link State Routing

#### Implement link state routing algorithm.

## Lab 8 - GNS3 Network Emulator

#### Set up and install GNS3 to emulate, configure, test, and troubleshoot virtual networks.
